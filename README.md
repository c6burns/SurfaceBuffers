# SurfaceBuffers
cross platform test for compute / procedural instancing / structured buffer support within surface shaders

This is a proof of concept method, effective in rendering APIs available across all modern platforms: Win, OSX, *nix, Android, iOS

It allows the output of compute shaders to be used directly in Unity surface shaders
